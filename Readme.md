# Typescript mocha coverage

This project is a base project having coverage working for typescript.

## Dependencies

## Run

After project initialization (with `npm i`) you can execute the following commands :

- `npm test` : Runs coverage by using [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) (`nyc`)
- `npm run-script mocha` : Runs test by using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)

## In VS Code

Plugin [mocha-sidebar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maty.vscode-mocha-sidebar) executes tests, but coverage is still missing.
